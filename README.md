# SAS Health Metrics Analysis: BMI Categorization and Gender Insights

## Overview
The **SAS Health Metrics Analysis: BMI Categorization and Gender Insights** project focuses on analyzing health metrics and individual statistics using SAS programming. This project involves importing data from Excel sheets, calculating Body Mass Index (BMI), categorizing individuals based on their BMI values, and visualizing the distribution of health status categories with pie charts. Additionally, macros are used to generate frequency tables and reports, exploring the relationship between gender and BMI status for a comprehensive analysis.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains Excel sheets with individual statistics and health metrics in the [Input_Datasets]() folder.
- **Code**: SAS code files in [Solution 1.sas]() for data importing, BMI calculation, categorization, visualization, and frequency table generation.
- **Outputs**: [Results_Solution 1.sas.pdf]() includes pie charts, frequency tables, and reports.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Import Data**: Import data from Excel sheets containing health statistics and history.
  
2. **Organize Data**: Prepare the imported data for further analysis.

3. **Convert Measurements**: Convert weight and height from the imported data into metric units.

4. **Calculate BMI**: Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for each individual using metric weight and height.

5. **Categorize Individuals**: Group individuals into distinct health status categories based on their BMI values.

6. **Generate Pie Chart**: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of health status categories.

7. **Create Frequency Tables and Reports**: Use macros to generate frequency tables and reports, analyzing the relationship between gender and BMI status.

8. **Analyze Relationships**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of the relationships between gender and BMI status using the generated tables and reports.

9. **Gain Insights**: Extract valuable insights about the health profiles of the studied population to inform decision-making.

## Instructions
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure Excel sheets with individual statistics and health metrics are in the designated folder.
   
2. **SAS Environment Setup**: Configure the SAS environment and ensure necessary libraries are accessible.
   
3. **Code Execution**: Run the provided SAS code files in the specified order to import data, calculate BMI, categorize health status, visualize distributions, and generate frequency tables.
   
4. **Review Outputs**: Check the generated outputs in the "Outputs" folder, including pie charts, frequency tables, and reports.
   
5. **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigate the relationships between gender and BMI status using the generated frequency tables and reports.
